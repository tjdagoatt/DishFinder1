Summary

This document summarizes my progress building DishFinder, an Android app that allows users to search for real recipes using a free public API (TheMealDB). The app supports keyword searching, displays matching meals with images, and provides a full recipe detail screen including ingredients and cooking instructions.

Notes

TheMealDB API works extremely well for a beginner-friendly food app

Ingredients had to be dynamically parsed because the API provides ~20 ingredient/measure pairs

The back button safely returns the user to the previous search results

Very fun project — excited to polish final submission!
